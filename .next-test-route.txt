Routes that should work:
- /dashboard (works - returns 200)
- /dashboard/reply-to-reviews (404 - needs fixing)

File exists at: app/(dashboard)/reply-to-reviews/page.tsx

Next steps:
1. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear .next folder (already done)
3. Restart: npm run dev
4. Try the route again

If still 404, check terminal for compilation errors.
